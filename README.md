### Question 
How has the attendance at NFL games shifted in the past 19 years?
### Importance
This question is important because Football has undergone substantial changes in this time, including new rules, player dynamics, and strategic approaches. Our goal is to assess fans' perceptions of the current state of football by examining stadium attendance trends in NFL games over the last 19 years based on city. We anticipate that teams with consistent or improved performance during this period will likely show steady or growing attendance, while those experiencing declines in performance may see a decrease in attendance as well as see which if teams moved due to a decline in attendance. Our dataset comprises attendance records for both home and away NFL games spanning the past 19 years for each team including if the team moved cities in this time period.

### Vizualizations
1. Our first visualization is a map of the United States which shows attendance for each team at their respective geographical locations. We have excluded the New York Giants and the New York Jets from this visual because they play in the same stadium and this would skew the data. This is important for our quesrion to help show which areas are profitable for teams to be in and which areas draw less of a crowd. you could look deeper to look at the sports teams recoreds as well and see if that has an effect on the attendance as well.
2. A bar graph illustrating NFL game attendance across a 19-year timeline offers a visual of the attendance fluctuations and trends over this period. By presenting annual attendance figures in a graphical format, it enables an immediate assessment of how attendance has changed year by year. The graph allows for a quick comparison of attendance levels between different seasons, making it easier to identify peaks, lows, or patterns that signify changes in fan turnout. Analyzing the heights of the bars representing each year's attendance provides a straightforward way to grasp overall trends, spot outliers, and recognize any notable shifts in attendance dynamics, offering a clear and concise answer to how NFL game attendance has changed over the specified 19-year span.
3. A line graph representing NFL game attendance across a span of 19 years serves as a strong visual, showing us the shifts and overarching trends in fan turnout over this duration. The continuous line connecting yearly attendance data points offers a clear depiction of the attendance trajectory, enabling immediate recognition of any patterns, gradual changes, or abrupt shifts in fan engagement over time. By presenting a single view of attendance figures across nearly two decades, the line graph facilitates a understanding of the overarching direction—whether attendance has shown consistent growth, fluctuated periodically, had notable peaks or declines, or remained relatively stable. This visualization method becomes an important tool in comprehending the long-term change and dynamics of NFL game attendance, offering insights into the fan interest and engagement throughout the extended 19-year timeframe.
