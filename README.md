### Question 
How has the attendance at NFL games shifted in the past 19 years?
### Importance
Football has undergone substantial changes in this time, including new rules, player dynamics, and strategic approaches. Our goal is to assess fans' perceptions of the current state of football by examining stadium attendance trends in NFL games over the last 19 years based on city. We anticipate that teams with consistent or improved performance during this period will likely show steady or growing attendance, while those experiencing declines in performance may see a decrease in attendance as well as see which if teams moved due to a decline in attendance. Our dataset comprises attendance records for both home and away NFL games spanning the past 19 years for each team including if the team moved cities in this time period.

### Vizualizations
1. Our first visualization is a map of the United States which shows attendance for each team at their respective geographical locations. We have excluded the New York Giants and the New York Jets from this visual because they play in the same stadium and this would skew the data. This is important for our quesrion to help show which areas are profitable for teams to be in and which areas draw less of a crowd. you could look deeper to look at the sports teams recoreds as well and see if that has an effect on the attendance as well.
